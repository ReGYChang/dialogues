# Flink

This folder contains a series of dialogues to discuss the development, functionality, and applications of Flink.

## Data Streaming Concepts

- Event time processing
- Watermarks and late data handling
- Windowing: tumbling, sliding, and session windows

1. How does Flink provide exactly-once processing semantics?
2. What is the role of watermarks in Flink, and how do they help with event time processing?
3. What are the differences between tumbling, sliding, and session windows in Flink?

## Flink Architecture and Components

- Flink runtime architecture: JobManager and TaskManager
- Fault tolerance: stateful processing and state backends
- Savepoints and checkpoints

1. What is the role of JobManager and TaskManager in Flink's architecture?
2. How does Flink achieve fault tolerance and stateful processing?
3. What is the purpose of Flink's savepoints and checkpoints, and how do they differ?

## Flink DataStream API

- SourceFunction and SinkFunction
- KeyedStream, WindowedStream, and windowing operations
- Stateful operations: ValueState, ListState, MapState, and ReducingState

1. How can you implement a custom SourceFunction in Flink?
2. What is the difference between a KeyedStream and a WindowedStream in Flink?
3. How can you perform stateful operations in Flink using the DataStream API?

## Flink Table API and SQL

- Streaming joins and time-based operations
- Temporal table joins
- User-Defined Functions (UDFs), User-Defined Aggregates (UDAs), and User-Defined Table Functions (UDTFs)

1. How can you perform streaming joins in Flink SQL?
2. What are the benefits of using the Flink Table API over the DataStream API?
3. How can you register and use a User-Defined Function (UDF) in Flink SQL?

## Flink Connectors

- Apache Kafka Connector
- JDBC Connector
- Elasticsearch Connector
- File-based connectors (HDFS, S3, etc.)

1. How can you integrate Apache Kafka with Flink using the Flink Kafka Connector?
2. What is the role of Flink's JDBC connector in connecting to relational databases?
3. How can you use the Flink Elasticsearch connector to write data to Elasticsearch?

## Flink Metrics and Monitoring

- Built-in Flink metrics: throughput, latency, checkpointing, and backpressure
- Flink web dashboard
- Integrating Flink with external monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana, etc.)

1. How can you monitor the performance of a Flink application using its built-in metrics?
2. What is the role of Flink's web dashboard for monitoring and managing jobs?
3. How can you integrate Flink with monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana?

## Flink Deployment and Scaling

- Deployment modes: standalone, YARN, and Kubernetes
- Scaling Flink applications: parallelism, resource allocation, and dynamic scaling
- Memory management and backpressure configuration

1. What are the differences between deploying Flink on standalone mode, YARN, and Kubernetes?
2. How can you scale a Flink application horizontally to handle increased load?
3. What are some best practices for configuring Flink memory management and backpressure?

## Flink Advanced Features

- Iterative algorithms and iteration constructs
- Complex event processing with ProcessFunction
- Side outputs and multiple output streams

1. How can you implement iterative algorithms using Flink's iteration constructs?
2. What are the benefits of using Flink's ProcessFunction for complex event processing?
3. How can you use Flink's side outputs to handle multiple output streams?
