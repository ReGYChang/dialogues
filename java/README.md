# Java

This folder contains a series of dialogues to discuss the development, functionality, and applications of Java.

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts

- Inheritance: subclassing, abstract classes, and interfaces
- Polymorphism: method overriding, dynamic method dispatch, and interface implementation
- Encapsulation: data hiding, access modifiers, and getters/setters

1. What is the difference between an abstract class and an interface in Java?
2. How does Java achieve runtime polymorphism?
3. What are the benefits of encapsulation in Java?

### Java Collections Framework

- List: ArrayList, LinkedList
- Set: HashSet, TreeSet, LinkedHashSet
- Map: HashMap, TreeMap, LinkedHashMap
- Queue: PriorityQueue, LinkedList
- Collections: utility class, sorting, searching, and synchronization

1. What are the differences between ArrayList and LinkedList?
2. When should you use a HashMap vs. a TreeMap?
3. How can you make a Java collection thread-safe?

### Java Generics

- Parameterized types: generic classes, interfaces, and methods
- Type bounds: extends, super
- Wildcards

1. How do Java generics improve type safety?
2. What is the difference between a wildcard with an "extends" bound and one with a "super" bound?
3. How can you create a generic method in Java?

### Java Concurrency

- Threads: creating, starting, and managing threads
- Synchronization: synchronized blocks, methods, and static synchronization
- Locks: ReentrantLock, ReadWriteLock
- Executors: Executor, ExecutorService, and ScheduledExecutorService
- Concurrent collections: ConcurrentHashMap, CopyOnWriteArrayList, and CopyOnWriteArraySet
- Thread-safe data structures: BlockingQueue, LinkedBlockingQueue, ArrayBlockingQueue
- Atomic classes: AtomicInteger, AtomicLong, and AtomicReference

1. What is the difference between the Runnable and Callable interfaces?
2. How can you prevent deadlocks in Java?
3. What are the benefits of using the Executor framework over managing threads manually?

### Exception Handling

- Checked vs. unchecked exceptions
- Custom exception classes
- Best practices for exception handling

1. What is the difference between checked and unchecked exceptions in Java?
2. How can you create a custom exception class in Java?
3. What are some best practices for handling exceptions in Java?

### Input/Output (I/O) and Networking

- File I/O: File, FileReader, FileWriter, FileInputStream, FileOutputStream
- Buffered I/O: BufferedReader, BufferedWriter, BufferedInputStream, BufferedOutputStream
- Serialization: Serializable interface, ObjectInputStream, ObjectOutputStream
- Socket programming: Socket, ServerSocket, DatagramSocket

1. What is the difference between FileReader / FileWriter and FileInputStream / FileOutputStream in Java?
2. How can you serialize and deserialize an object in Java?
3. How do you create a simple client-server application using sockets in Java?

### Java 8+ Features

- Lambda expressions
- Stream API
- Optional class
- Date and Time API: LocalDate, LocalTime, LocalDateTime, ZonedDateTime
- Default and static methods in interfaces

1. How do lambda expressions work in Java?
2. What are some common use cases for the Stream API in Java?
3. How can you use Optional to avoid null pointer exceptions in Java?

### Java Reflection API

- Class introspection: Class, Method, Field, Constructor
- Dynamic object creation and method invocation
- Annotations and metadata processing

1. How can you use reflection to get information about a class at runtime?
2. How can you create an instance of a class using reflection in Java?
3. What is the purpose of annotations in Java?

### Java Virtual Machine (JVM)

- Memory management: heap, stack, and garbage collection
- Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation
- Class loading and dynamic class loading
- Performance tuning and optimization

1. How does the Java garbage collector work?
2. What is the role of Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation in the JVM?
3. What are some common Java performance tuning techniques?

### Java Design Patterns

- Creational patterns: Singleton, Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Builder, Prototype
- Structural patterns: Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Proxy
- Behavioral patterns: Chain of Responsibility, Command, Interpreter, Iterator, Mediator, Memento, Observer, State, Strategy, Template Method, Visitor

1. How does the Singleton design pattern work, and when should you use it?
2. What is the difference between the Adapter and Bridge design patterns?
3. Can you explain the Observer design pattern and provide a Java example?

These topics should give you a good understanding of advanced Java concepts. Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
