# Dialogues

This repository contains a series of dialogues between `students` and `professors` on `various topics`, with a focus on explaining complex concepts in simpler terms. Each dialogue aims to provide an engaging and educational experience for those interested in learning more about the respective topics. Enjoy the conversations and feel free to contribute!

- Each dialogue is stored in a separate Markdown file, e.g., `dialogue_1.md`.
