## Roadmap

### Basics of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML)

Start by learning about the fundamental concepts of AI and ML, including supervised and unsupervised learning, classification, regression, and the basics of neural networks.

### Deep learning:

Dive into deep learning, which is a subset of ML that focuses on artificial neural networks with many layers. Learn about convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to understand their limitations and the motivation behind the development of transformers.

### Natural language processing (NLP):

Study the field of NLP, which focuses on making computers understand, interpret, and generate human language. Familiarize yourself with key NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, machine translation, and question-answering.

### Word embeddings:

Learn about word embeddings, which are dense vector representations of words that capture their meanings and relationships with other words. Understand popular techniques like Word2Vec and GloVe and their role in NLP models.

### Transformers and self-attention:

Study the transformer architecture and the self-attention mechanism, which are crucial components of LLMs like GPT-4. Understand how transformers overcome the limitations of RNNs and why they're so effective in NLP tasks.

### GPT and its evolution:

Learn about the development and evolution of the GPT series of models, starting from GPT-1 to GPT-4. Understand the improvements and advancements made in each version and their impact on NLP and AI research.

### Training and fine-tuning LLMs:

Familiarize yourself with the process of training and fine-tuning LLMs. Learn about techniques like transfer learning, data augmentation, and the use of domain-specific data for fine-tuning.

### Applications of LLMs:

Explore the wide range of applications for LLMs, including text summarization, machine translation, question-answering, and chatbot development. Study real-world use cases and understand how LLMs can be adapted for various tasks.

### Ethical considerations:

Understand the ethical implications and challenges associated with LLMs, such as bias, fairness, and responsible AI development. Learn about techniques for mitigating these issues and promoting ethical AI practices.

### Hands-on experience:

Finally, gain hands-on experience by working with LLMs using popular deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch. Experiment with pre-trained models, fine-tune them for specific tasks, and develop your own NLP applications.
